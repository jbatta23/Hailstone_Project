# Hailstone_Project
This is our repo for the hailstone project, a UC Berkeley mathematics and data science lab.

# Description
We worked as a lab to create a dataset to understand and work with the Collatz Conjecture. Specifically we: 
1. Completed a full dataset of the first 500 numbers to track the odd numbers present in the Collatz Conjecture.
2. Defined a new term of numbers in the Collatz Conjecture called trigger numbers.
3. Defined a backtracking algorithm to move to each trigger number present in the Collatz Conjecture.
It is our hope that this data and the code/algorithms we present can be used to potentialy solve the Collatz Conjecture or gain additional insights into various numbers.
